# Team Search and Rescue

Team Search and Rescue is a simple game environment designed to explore human-agent / human-robot teaming for search and rescue tasks.  The environment is designed so that humans and/or agents need to address a set of tasks, such as providing medical assistance, putting out fires, etc.  Agents / humans can be resource-limited in several senses:  limited observability, limited resources to address tasks (e.g., medical supplies, extinguishers, etc.), etc.


# Requirements

The game environment is developed in Python.
